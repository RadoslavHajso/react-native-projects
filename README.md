# React Native Projects

This repository contains projects I worked on while learning **React Native**. It showcases my journey through core concepts like navigation, forms, backend integration, and more.

### Submodules & Organization
The repository includes submodules such as **F1 App Clone** and **Laundry App**, which are part of my personal GitHub organization. Since these are learning projects and clones, I’ve kept them in the organization to keep my profile clean.

### Projects in this Repository:
- **F1 App Clone (TypeScript)**: A clone of the Formula 1 app, fetching live race data via **GraphQL**.
- **Laundry App**: A simple app built to experiment with **React Native**.

### Why I Built These Clones
These clones were part of my learning process. They helped me explore backend services like **AWS**, **StepZen**, and **Firebase**. I have a few more clones that are private or hosted elsewhere, which I use to practice more advanced features for my **own private app**.

### My Ongoing Project
I’m currently working on a private mobile app, where I’m applying what I’ve learned. This app will feature advanced functionalities I gained from working with these clones.

**Note**: Although many of these projects are clones, they serve as stepping stones to building my own private app, where I plan to implement advanced features I've learned along the way.

### Early Views of My Developing App
Here’s a small preview of my private app. The app already has a logo and additional features that are not visible in these screenshots. The app already has a logo and includes several features that are not shown in these images. The screenshots only show the login and logout functionalities, but there are more features under development. Since the project is still private, I prefer not to share the full details just yet.
